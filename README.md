# bookbot_py

BookBot is my first git project!

- It takes a text file as input and gives back the number of words and times each character found ordered from highest to lowest.


## Running it

- Have python3 installed
- fork and clone the repo,
`git clone https://github.com/<Your-UserName>/bookbot_py.git`
- In the project's home directory run `mkdir && cd books`, add your own `<file-name>.txt`
- run `cd ..` and change the [path](https://github.com/KiranSatyaRaj/bookbot_py/blob/main/main.py#L21) 
with the `books/<file-name>.txt` in [main.py](https://github.com/KiranSatyaRaj/bookbot_py/blob/main/main.py), and save it
- run `python3 main.py`
